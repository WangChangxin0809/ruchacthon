"""Prove every gate in this directory can turn red, and turn green.

    python3 scripts/gates/selftest.py [--verbose]

    0 = every gate passed both directions    1 = a gate failed    2 = cannot run

A gate nobody has watched fail is a file, not a check. This builds a throwaway
git repository in a temporary directory, plants a defect each gate must catch,
and asserts the gate exits 1 *and* names the defect. Then it removes the defect
and asserts the gate exits 0.

Both directions matter and for different reasons. Only checking that it goes red
lets through a gate that is red on everything, which people learn to ignore
within a week. Only checking green lets through a gate that never fires, which
is worse because it looks like evidence.

The failure assertion greps the output for a specific string rather than only
checking the exit code. Exit 1 is a shared observable -- several unrelated
failures produce it, and a selftest that asserts only the code passes for the
wrong reason, which is exactly the bug it is supposed to catch.
